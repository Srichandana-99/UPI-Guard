# Real-time UPI Fraud Detection System

A full-stack application that demonstrates real-time fraud detection for UPI transactions using a machine learning model (XGBoost). The system consists of a payment gateway simulator, a real-time monitoring dashboard, and a robust fraud detection engine.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Instantly analyzes transactions using a pretrained XGBoost model.
*   **Production Grade Backend**: Uses **SQLite** for persistent transaction history and statistical feature engineering.
*   **Hybrid Security**: Combines ML predictions with statistical anomaly rules (e.g., spending patterns).
*   **Interactive Dashboard**: A live monitor that visualizes transactions and alerts in real-time.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive React frontend, also convertible to a native Android app via Capacitor.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
*   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Uvicorn
*   **ML Engine**: XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Pandas
*   **Mobile**: Capacitor (Android)

## 📂 Project Structure

*   `backend/`: FastAPI server, ML logic (`fraud_engine.py`), and the pretrained model (`model.pkl`).
*   `frontend/`: React application source code.
    *   `src/pages/Home.jsx`: Main payment interface.
    *   `src/pages/Monitor.jsx`: Real-time fraud dashboard.
*   `frontend/android`: Native Android project generated by Capacitor.

## 📥 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srichandana-99/UPI-Guard.git
cd UPI-Guard
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
# Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
Once dependencies are installed, you can start both servers with a single command:
```bash
# Make the script executable (only needed once)
chmod +x run.sh

# Start the app
./run.sh
```
This script will:
*   Start the FastAPI backend on port `8000`.
*   Start the React frontend on port `5173`.
*   Handle graceful shutdown of both servers when you press `Ctrl+C`.

### Option 2: Manual Run

#### Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
# Activate venv if you used one
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```
> Server runs at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Start Frontend
Open a new terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
> App runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📱 Android App (Optional)
To run the project as a native Android app:
```bash
cd frontend
npx cap open android
```
> This opens the project in Android Studio for emulation.

## 🧪 How to Test

1.  **Open the App**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
2.  **Open Monitor**: Click the "Monitor" button.
3.  **Teach the System (Normal Behavior)**:
    *   Use a new UPI ID (e.g., `myuser@upi`).
    *   Make 3-4 small transactions (₹100, ₹500, ₹200).
    *   *Result*: **Success** (Green).
4.  **Test Fraud Detection (Anomaly)**:
    *   For the *same user* (`myuser@upi`), try to send a huge amount (e.g., ₹50,000).
    *   *Result*: **Fraud Detected** (Red - "High Value Anomaly").
    *   *Why*: The system detects this is 100x your average spending.

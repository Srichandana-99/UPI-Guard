# Real-time UPI Fraud Detection System

A full-stack application that demonstrates real-time fraud detection for UPI transactions using a machine learning model (XGBoost). The system consists of a payment gateway simulator, a real-time monitoring dashboard, and a robust fraud detection engine.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Instantly analyzes transactions using a pretrained XGBoost model.
*   **Production Grade Backend**: Uses **SQLite** for persistent transaction history and statistical feature engineering.
*   **Hybrid Security**: Combines ML predictions with statistical anomaly rules (e.g., spending patterns).
*   **Interactive Dashboard**: A live monitor that visualizes transactions and alerts in real-time.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive React frontend, also convertible to a native Android app via Capacitor.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
*   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Uvicorn
*   **ML Engine**: XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Pandas
*   **Mobile**: Capacitor (Android)

## 📂 Project Structure

*   `backend/`: FastAPI server, ML logic (`fraud_engine.py`), and the pretrained model (`model.pkl`).
*   `frontend/`: React application source code.
    *   `src/pages/Home.jsx`: Main payment interface.
    *   `src/pages/Monitor.jsx`: Real-time fraud dashboard.
*   `frontend/android`: Native Android project generated by Capacitor.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js & npm
*   Python 3.10+
*   Android Studio (for mobile app)

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# If on macOS, you might need: brew install libomp
python3 main.py
```
Server will start at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
App will run at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Android App
```bash
cd frontend
npx cap open android
```
This opens the project in Android Studio, where you can run it on a simulator or device.

## 🧪 How to Test

1.  **Open the App**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
2.  **Open Monitor**: Click the "Monitor" button.
3.  **Teach the System (Normal Behavior)**:
    *   Use a new UPI ID (e.g., `myuser@upi`).
    *   Make 3-4 small transactions (₹100, ₹500, ₹200).
    *   *Result*: **Success** (Green).
4.  **Test Fraud Detection (Anomaly)**:
    *   For the *same user* (`myuser@upi`), try to send a huge amount (e.g., ₹50,000).
    *   *Result*: **Fraud Detected** (Red - "High Value Anomaly").
    *   *Why*: The system detects this is 100x your average spending.
